In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## TechStack Used

React.JS
Typescript

## FYI

I have made the screens but haven't focused on hydrating the page(search , filter etc will not work)

## TODOS

Since I only got 1 day to develop the screens , but in future I can also add:

1. Test cases
2. Mobile Responsiveness
3. Create a wrapper with navbar and wrap our main app component into it
